2) Difference between reference code and project code:

* The code uses both train_size and test_size meaning they define the amount of data which is given to train and test. The accuracy for this 
code increases when we increase the size of training data but for our code this logic works in reverse way which we concluded after testing the data with
different sizes of training data. 

* We use only train size for code meaning, if we declare the size of training data as 50% then it automatically takes the
size of testing data as the other half 50%.
